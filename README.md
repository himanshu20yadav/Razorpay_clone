Welcome to the RazorPay Clone UI project! This project replicates the user interface of the popular online payment gateway, RazorPay. This README file will guide you through setting up the project, but please note that we won't be uploading the `node_modules` directory. You will need to download the necessary Node modules separately.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A code editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
- A web browser to view the RazorPay Clone UI.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): This project uses Node.js for managing Node modules and running the development server.

## Downloading Node Modules

The Node modules necessary for this project are not included in the repository to keep the project lightweight. To download and install the required Node modules, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the project directory where you have cloned the RazorPay Clone UI project.

3. Run the following command to download the required Node modules using `npm`:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will create a `node_modules` directory in your project folder and install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded the Node modules, follow these steps to set up and run the RazorPay Clone UI:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/razorpay_clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd razorpay_clone
   ```

3. Open the project folder in your code editor to view and edit the HTML and Tailwind CSS files.

## Usage

The RazorPay Clone UI is a static HTML page styled with Tailwind CSS. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the user interface. You can customize and expand the UI as needed for your project.
